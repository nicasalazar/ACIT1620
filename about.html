        <p> Hi, My name is Dannicah! I am the second oldest of 6 girls. I enjoy reading, coding, drinking wine, baking and chilling with my 2 dogs named <strong> Winnie the Pooh & Piglet </strong> </p>
        
        <p> I am currently attending BCIT to become an IT Developer just like my mom. She currently works as the <em>Director of IT</em> in Best Buy Headquarters and teaches me coding on the side. I hope to become 1 step closer to acheiveing this goal once I finish this program.</p>
