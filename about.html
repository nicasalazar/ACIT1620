        <p> Hi, My name is Dannicah! I am the second oldest of 6 girls. I enjoy reading, coding, drinking wine, baking and chilling with my 2 dogs named <strong> Winnie the Pooh & Piglet </strong> </p>
        
        <p> I am currently attending the BCIT CIT Winter 2021 program to become an IT Developer just like my mom. She currently works as the <em>Director of IT</em> in Best Buy Headquarters and teaches me coding on the side. I hope to become 1 step closer to acheiveing this goal once I finish this program.</p>
        
        <p>Since this program is basically a full time job and I truly enjoy baking, I created an instagram sweets and bakery shop for other to purchase my handmade goodies! I will be using the money I earn to help me financially throughout the school year</p>

        <p> I hope to develop my HTML and CSS skills so I can eventually set up my sweets and bakery website so others can purchase my baked goods and treat boxes from other platforms. But for now you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/littlepiggysweets_/?hl=en">Instagram</a> if you are interested in purchasing! </p>
